		<p id = "aboutmetext">My name is Will Hunnicutt. I am a first-year CS Major at Georgia Tech. I am originally from LaGrange, GA and am currently living on-campus at Georgia Tech. While I attended LaGrange High School, I was involved in many activities such as tennis, Young Life, and chorus. I am currently interested in video games such as Overwatch and Rocket League which I play on my desktop PC that I built. I love dancing and anything musical. I am an avid music-listener and love to keep up with new releases. I am a member of the Beta Alpha Chapter of the Theta Xi Fraternity and am involved in the Homecoming Committee of the fraternity. Hit the 'Activities/Interests' button to learn even more about what I enjoy!</p>
